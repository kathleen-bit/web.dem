        <!----------------------------- CHILDHOOD PART ----------------------->
        <div class="childhood">
            <h3 style="padding-bottom: 15px;">Childhood Years</h3>
            <p><blockquote> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
                <sup><b>1</b></sup> When I was a child, I used to have <b>big dreams</b>; becoming a <i>president</i>, a <i>CEO</i> of my own business, 
                            to become a <i>billionaire</i> and help people, become <i>famous</i>, and many other things.

                <sup><b>2</b></sup> I also remember that me and my siblings had this <em>impossible</em> recurring memory every time we got together—we 
                            said that we wanted to build a <u><i><b>time machine</b></i></u>.
                <sup><b>3</b></sup> <i>How awesome would that be</i> if we were able to do it?
                <sup><b>4</b></sup> I used to remember that I would be <b>embarrassed</b> when there was an assignment or project that asked—
                                <i>What is your childhood dream?</i>,
                                <i>What is your dream when you were a child?</i>, <i>What did you want to do when you grow up?</i>
                                Thinking about it now, why was I so embarrassed to share it? 
                                Why was I so shy to share my big dreams?
                                Is it because they would perceive me as <b><i>arrogant</i></b> and <b><i>naïve</i></b>? Sadly, yes.
                <sup><b>5</b></sup> <b>Dreams</b> are like <i>stars</i> that shine at night and a <i>sun</i> that brightens the day.

                <sup><b>6</b></sup> They say that as you grow older, those dreams will <i>plummet</i> and <i>crash</i>, and I <b>wholeheartedly</b> believed it.
                <sup><b>7</b></sup> I was in 5th grade when I first experienced that <u><i><b>harsh reality</b></i></u>.
                <sup><b>8</b></sup> I was <i>young</i> and <i>naïve</i>, yet I acted like I already knew the world.
                <sup><b>9</b></sup> Is it because I am the <i>oldest</i>? I think so, because as the eldest sibling, 
                                    I was tasked with disciplining my younger brothers and sisters.
                <sup><b>10</b></sup> I would teach them what was <i>right</i> and <i>wrong</i>, tell them their <i>responsibilities</i>, and <i>guide</i> them.
            </blockquote></p>

            </br>
            </br>

            <p><blockquote> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
                <sup><b>1</b></sup> This makes me think at that time that I have so much <i>knowledge</i> and <i>wisdom</i> to share, 
                and when things go wrong in our class ... <i>maybe... just maybe</i> I can be of any help; and <b>boy, I was wrong!</b>
                That day, we were doing an activity, <em>the room was pitch silence</em>, focusing on our own, 
                and our teacher got out of the classroom and left us for a few minutes, and there’s this guy 
                who is so loud – acting like <b>he owns the place</b>, shouting and laughing with his friends.

                <sup><b>2</b></sup> It gets to the point that we were <b>not able</b> to make our activity because we lost our interest in doing so. 
                
                <sup><b>3</b></sup>I remember that they were <i>crumpling some papers</i> and trying to shoot it into our small trash can 
                like it was some kind of basketball.

                <sup><b>3</b></sup> The trash can got full, and thus, it <i>overflowed</i>. Our group of friends – mostly girls were so 
                <b>fed up</b> with him that you could see it on our faces that we were annoyed by him.

                <sup><b>4</b></sup> So, me, being an <i>‘older sister’</i>, came up to him and <b>politely</b> asked him to <i>tone it down</i> 
                because we were doing an activity and we couldn’t focus when they were being loud and he just <i>shunned me off</i> 
                and when you are a <b>kid</b>, you are prone to <b>embarrassment</b> and the need for <b>acceptance by others.</b> 

                <sup><b>5</b></sup> Thus, I <i>awkwardly</i> tried it again, hoping that they would stop, but he just <b>ignored</b> me again. 
                I felt <i>humiliated</i> and was put to <i>shame</i>.

                <sup><b>6</b></sup> At that time, I was so <b>keen</b> on being this <b><i>wise</i></b> and <b><i>knowledgeable</i></b> kid that even at school 
                I <i>followed through</i> it.

                <sup><b>7</b></sup> Hence, I <b>grabbed the collar of his shirt</b> I was so pissed 
                that I didn’t even say anything and just looked at him, <b>piercingly through his eyes </b> , 
                Then he <i>smirked</i>; tried to punch me, but I evaded it;
                Then he tried to punch me again, and <b>I avoided it <u>again</u>.</b>

                <sup><b>8</b></sup> On the second punch, our classmates stopped us and separated us so that we could <i>cool our heads off</i>.
                At that time, I was so <b>mad</b> because I didn’t get to <i>punch him</i>,
                But thinking about it now, it’s okay because I know that <b>he was so embarrassed</b> 
                that a <b>girl</b>—who was holding only his shirt with one hand—could not land a punch on <i>her</i> face— <u><i><b>on my face.</b></i></u>
                <sup><b>9</b></sup> The ending of that story is that we were called to the guidance but they didn’t call our parents.
                <sup><b>10</b></sup> That’s how my <b>first dream</b>, my <b>first star</b>, <i>crashed</i>.

        <!-----------------------TEENAGE YEARS--------------------->
        <div class="teens">
            <h3 style="padding-bottom: 15px;">Teenage Years</h3>
            <p><blockquote> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                <sup><b>1</b></sup> I was determined to <i>transform</i> myself when I reached high school.
                <sup><b>2</b></sup> My goal at the time was to find a <i>trustworthy circle of friends</i>, become the <i>top student</i> academically, 
                and create <i>fun, unforgettable memories</i>.
                <sup><b>3</b></sup> However, as 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th grade passed, I remained the same Kathleen I had been in elementary school.

                <sup><b>4</b></sup> Yes, I found the <i>circle of friends</i> I had always wanted and got to experience some
                 <i>enjoyable moments</i>, but <b>nothing truly memorable</b>.
                <sup><b>5</b></sup> I was still a <i>quiet kid</i>, unsure how to <i>converse</i> with anyone outside my friend group.
                <sup><b>6</b></sup> I desperately sought <i>acceptance</i> and <i>attention</i> by acting mysterious and reserved, 
                but it never worked—and I realized it too late.
                <sup><b>7</b></sup> Then came 11th grade, during the <i>pandemic</i>, when the whole world was in quarantine.
                <sup><b>8</b></sup> During that time, I watched <b><i>countless self-improvement videos</i></b> on YouTube, 
                trying different hacks, methods, and advice.
                <sup><b>9</b></sup> Some worked, while others didn’t.
                <sup><b>10</b></sup> In my mind, I believed I was becoming a <b>better version</b> of myself—one who could <i>joke around, 
                    express emotions,</i> and <i>engage with others <b>more freely</b></i> .
                <sup><b>11</b></sup> When 12th grade arrived, our school finally allowed face-to-face classes again.
                <sup><b>12</b></sup> At first, I was excited to meet my classmates because I thought this <i>new version</i> of myself would make it easier to 
                befriend people.
                <sup><b>13</b></sup> I believed that after all the <i>self-improvement</i> I had done, I would finally be more 
                social, more confident—someone people would want to be around.
                <sup><b>14</b></sup> But I was <b>wrong...</b> <i>again.</i>
                <sup><b>15</b></sup> Not only did I struggle to befriend anyone, but I also felt like <b>I was annoying</b>.
                <sup><b>16</b></sup> Every time I tried to join a conversation, I overthought my words, 
                <b>afraid</b> of saying something <i>awkward</i>.
                <sup><b>17</b></sup> I <b>forced</b> myself to be more outgoing, but instead of feeling <i>natural</i>, 
                it felt like <i>I was putting on an act</i>—one that <b>no one really noticed</b> or <b>cared about</b>.
                <sup><b>18</b></sup> The worst part was realizing that despite all my efforts to change, I still felt like an <b><i>outsider</i></b>.
                <sup><b>19</b></sup> It was as if no matter how much I tried to <i>reinvent myself</i>, I was stuck in the same cycle of 
                <i>self-doubt</i> and <i>loneliness</i>.
                <sup><b>20</b></sup> But looking back, I realize there were still some moments in my teenage years when 
                I was <b>truly myself</b>—especially when I graduated from senior high school.
                <sup><b>21</b></sup> One of my <b>best friends</b>, <i>Rona</i>, was there.
                <sup><b>22</b></sup> We were able to graduate together since we attended the same school, 
                She was someone I <b>always turned to</b> whenever I had problems, I would always message 
                her to come along with me when I wanted to go shopping.
                <sup><b>23</b></sup> I was so <b>thankful</b> for her and all of my best friends at that time because, with them, 
                there was <b>no need to pretend</b>, <b>no need to wear a mask</b>.
                <sup><b>24</b></sup> I could simply be <i><b>myself</b></i>.
                <sup><b>25</b></sup> Those moments reminded me that <i>maybe, just maybe</i>, 
                <b>I could be better</b>—not by <i>changing</i> who I was, but by <em>embracing</em> it.
                <sup><b>26</b></sup> I guess you could say that this time, <i><u><b>I was able to catch a star</b></u></i>.

        <!-----------------------COLLEGE YEARS--------------------->
        <div class="college">
            <h3 style="padding-bottom: 15px;">College Years</h3>
            <p><blockquote> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  
                <sup><b>1</b></sup> As I stepped into college, I carried that <i>hope</i> with me—<i>new environment, new faces,</i> 
                and a <i>fresh start</i>—this was my chance to finally grow into the person I had always wanted to be.
                <sup><b>2</b></sup> But little did I know, college would bring its own set of <b>challenges</b> and <b>lessons</b> 
                that would shape me in ways I <i>never expected</i>.
                <sup><b>3</b></sup> When I was in my 1st yearof college, everything was going great—at least for the first half, 
                since it was online.
                <sup><b>4</b></sup> I had gotten used to the comfort of studying at home, where I didn’t have to worry about 
                <i>social interactions</i> or the <i>pressure</i> of making friends.
                <sup><b>5</b></sup> But when the university announced that <b>face-to-face classes would resume </b> in the second semester, 
                I was not excited nor nervous.
                <sup><b>6</b></sup> I was <i>normal</i>, no reaction—just purely <i>laziness</i> saying, <i>“ayoko pumasok ng f2f, nakakatamad.”</i> 
                This time, I didn’t bother setting any expectations.
                <sup><b>8</b></sup> I had learned my lesson in senior high—expectations only led to <i>disappointment</i>.
                <sup><b>9</b></sup> I didn’t want to <i>hope</i> for a fresh start or believe that I’d <b>suddenly become more 
                outgoing</b> just because I was in a <i>new environment</i>.
                <sup><b>10</b></sup> Instead, I wanted to have a <b>fresh start</b>—not in the sense of becoming someone <b>entirely new</b>, 
                but in <i>truly discovering who I was</i>.
                <sup><b>11</b></sup> I realized that finding myself wasn’t about chasing a single, fixed version of me—it was a 
                <i>continuous process</i>, a journey of <i>growth</i> and <i>change</i>.
                <sup><b>12</b></sup> We are always evolving, shaped by our experiences, the people we meet, and the <b>lessons</b> 
                we learn along the way.
                <sup><b>13</b></sup> But one thing I was <b>certain of</b>—<i>I didn’t want to become someone I didn’t recognize.</i>
                <sup><b>14</b></sup> I didn’t want to achieve my dreams only to realize that, in the process, I had lost myself.
                <sup><b>15</b></sup> <b><i><u>Success means nothing if it comes at the cost of authenticity.</u></i></b>
                <sup><b>16</b></sup> I’ve seen people who reached their goals yet felt empty because they weren’t truly happy
                with who they had become.
                <sup><b>17</b></sup> Especially in college, where you will meet people from <i>different backgrounds</i> and <i>situations</i>, 
                <i><b>it’s easy to lose yourself in the process of fitting in.</b></i>
                <sup><b>18</b></sup> You see others chasing some things in ways you never considered, 
                adopting <i>mindsets</i> and <i>lifestyles</i> that don’t align with who you are.
                <sup><b>19</b></sup> That’s why my goal in college is simple—and that is to just stay true to myself.
                <sup><b>20</b></sup> I don’t want to be swayed by others, to <i>change</i> just to blend in, or 
                to <i>adopt attitudes</i> that don’t reflect who I really am.
                <sup><b>21</b></sup> But I’ll admit, <b><i>staying true to yourself is easier said than done.</i></b>
                <sup><b>22</b></sup> When I was in my 2nd year, I found myself getting influenced by the people around me. 
                I tried to match their <i>energy</i>, their <i>habits</i>, their <i>ways of thinking</i>—<b>It was a wake-up call.</b>
                <sup><b>24</b></sup> I asked myself every time, <i>why did I do that?</i> And every time, I would know the answer—and it’s because deep down, 
                I was actively chasing their approvals —wanting to be seen, to belong, to feel like I was enough.
                <sup><b>26</b></sup> <i>I molded myself to fit in, thinking that if I acted a certain way, I would finally feel accepted.</i>
                <sup><b>27</b></sup> But doing so, I realized that I was slowly drifting away from who I really was.
                <sup><b>28</b></sup> The <b>worst part</b> was that no matter how much I tried to align myself with them, I
                <i>never truly felt</i> like I <b>belonged</b>.

                <sup><b>29</b></sup> It was exhausting—I became so focused on being liked that I forgot to ask myself: 
                <i>are you truly happy?</i> Still, to this day, knowing this and repeating the same cycle hurts.

                <sup><b>31</b></sup> But I want to <b>get that star</b>, <i>I have hope</i>, because at the end of the day, 
                I don’t want to look back and realize I spent my college years pretending to be someone I’m not.

                <sup><b>32</b></sup> I want to graduate knowing that I stayed true to myself, made meaningful connections, and 
                grew in a way that felt right for me—not for anyone else.
